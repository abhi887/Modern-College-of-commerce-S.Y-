HOW TO BRUSH TEETH

The six steps below show you how to brush your child's teeth correctly (18 months to 6 years):

1.Smear a pea-sized amount of low-flouride toothpaste onto a soft children's toothbrush.

  
2.Sit the child in your lap, facing away from you, or stand behind taller children.  Tilt the child's head back against your body so you can see all the surfaces of the teeth.

  
3.Angle the bristles of the toothbrush towards the gum.  Move the brush in gentle circles to clean the outer sides of the teeth and gums.

  
4.Rush in gentle circles on the inside of the teeth and gums.

  
5.Brush back and forward on the chewing surface of the teeth.
  
6.After brushing all the surfaces, encourage your child to spit out the toothpaste

HOW TO TIE A SHOE KNOT

Tips: 

1.If you are teaching yourself or a kid how to do this, don't do it all on one day. Try to do it for 10 minutes per day for a week or so.
2.Remember, practice makes perfect, so keep practicing your tying method and you’ll soon be able to do it quickly and easily.
3.If you take it slowly, you have a better chance of getting it right.
4.Keep in mind there's no right or wrong way to tie your shoes. You can tie your shoes any way you'd like, as long as you're comfortable in your shoes and can walk without pain.
5.Pick the way that is the easiest for you. It will let you tie your shoes more quickly.
6.When you have made the loops, if they are slipping just pull the loops until it feels right.


1 Place the shoes on a flat surface. Let the laces fall to either side of the shoe •If you’re demonstrating this technique to someone, point the toe side
 of the shoe toward them so they can see your hand movements.
•To make it easier for children, color the bottom of one shoelace brown, the middle part of the lace green, and the top part of the lace brown. 
This way, when you instruct them to make a loop with the lace, it can look like trying to form a “tree” by always making sure the green part of the lace 
is at the top of the loop, like the leaves at the top of a tree.

2 Tie a basic knot. Take both laces and thread one lace over the other and then pull them tight. They should form a knot in the middle of the shoe.
 
3 Make a loop with one of the laces. You should be holding the lace between your thumb and your first two fingers. 
•If you are using the “tree” trick, instruct your child to form a loop with the colored lace so the brown parts of the lace are on 
top of each other (the trunk of the tree) and the green part sits at the top of the loop (the leaves of the tree).

4 Use your other hand to wrap the other lace around the loop. You should be holding it over your fingers and around the loop. 
Wrap the other lace toward you rather than away from you
•Again, if you are using the “tree” trick, instruct your child to wrap the 
shoelace with the knot over the “trunk” of the tree.

5 Pull the shoelace through the hole to form another loop. You should use your free hand to pull the shoelace through. 
There should now be a hole between the looped shoelace and the wrapped shoelace. Pull the wrapped shoelace through so it comes through this hole. 
•Another way to explain this is to have your child poke the knot on the shoelace through the hole to make another loop.

6 Hold both loops and pull them tight. You should now have a nicely tied shoe. •You can also instruct your child to pull the knot and the top of the tree
 trunk to either side, tightly.


Method 2: 


Using the "Bunny Ears" Technique

1 Place the shoes on a flat surface. Let the laces fall to either side of the shoe.

2 Tie a basic knot. Take both laces and thread one lace over the other and then pull them tight. They should form a knot in the middle of the shoe. 

3 Make a “bunny ear” loop with one of the laces. You should be holding the lace between your thumb and your first two fingers.
 The loop should be small and the “tail” should be long. 

4 Make a “bunny ear” loop with the other lace. Hold the lace between your thumb and first two fingers. Make the “tail” long and the loop small. 

5 Tie a basic knot with the “bunny ear” loops. Place one loop over the other, then tuck it behind the other and thread it through the hole that is created. 

6 Pull the “bunny ear” loops tight. Now your shoes are tied nicely. 



Method 3:

Using the "Circle" Technique 

1 Place the shoes on a flat surface. Let the laces fall to either side of the shoe.•If you’re demonstrating this technique to someone,
 point the toe side of the shoe toward them so they can see your hand movements.

2 Tie a basic knot. Take both laces and thread one lace over the other and then pull them tight. They should form a knot in the middle of the shoe.

3 Tie another knot, but don’t tighten it. Keep the second knot loose. Notice there is a circle shape formed by the knot. 
Hold the circle shape with your hand and lay it flat against the shoe.

4 Thread one shoelace into the circle. Make sure it comes up through the circle and over to one side. 
You can keep it loose, but make sure it does not slide all the way out of circle.

5 Thread the other shoelace into the circle. It should come up through the circle and over to the other side of the shoe
•You should now have two loops on either side of the knot in the center of the shoe.

6 Pull the loops tight. Use your hands to pull the loops tight so they are secure. Now your shoes are tied.




HOW TO GREET A PERSON


Easy Ways Parents Can Help Children Learn to Greet People  

1. Teach your child to look for the color of people’s eyes. Making eye contact is an important part of greetings. Young children may feel shy about looking
 into people’s eyes, and this makes the communication uneffective.
 
2. Help her stick to small sound bites. Brief your child right before walking into a store, library, or any other place
 where your child may meet people, and go over some things she can say. Tell her that if anyone asks how she is doing, all she has to do is say, “Fine, thank you.”
 Giving your child some short and simple sound bites to work with can help her feel less pressured about coming up with things to say.
 This can also prevent them from giving too much information that might be a safety issue.

3. Be supportive and encouraging. Review how things went with your child soon after he greets someone. 
If he wasn’t able to muster a hello, then reassure your child that you know that he will do better next time.
 If your child feels discouraged or feels like he didn't do something right or made a mistake, encourage him to learn from this 
and apply it to the next chance he has to greet someone. If things went well, tell him how proud you are of him for greeting someone so 
Say something like, “You made that person feel so good and brightened their day with your voice".

4. Teach your child to shake hands. Even kindergarteners can greet someone by shaking hands. 
Do some role-playing to help your child practice shaking hands and have him greet you with a confident handshake. 
Teach your child to face someone with his belly button and toes pointed toward that person when greeting that person.

5. Tell her to stand. If your child is seated—say at a restaurant or on the sofa at home—and a visitor or an acquaintance 
comes into the room or approaches him to say hello, teach him to stand up before saying his greetings.

6. Make it fun for your child. Don’t forget to make this about having fun and connecting with people rather than
presenting it as a chore kids have to do. Have a little fun while role-playing, and be sure to give them lots of praise.
Explain to your child that when she greets people politely, they will reward her with compliments.




Public Interaction:

1. Encourage eye-contact:
When talking to somebody, encourage your children to look into their eyes and talk for effective communication and to build confidence.
Your toddlers may need practice every day to master this art. Try games like ‘staring contest,’ tell your children to talk to their soft toys, or tell
you stories looking into your eyes.


2. Teach them emotions:
Let your children imitate a variety of emotions—joy, anger, disappointment, excitement, mischief, weirdness, nervousness, tiredness, terror, danger, etc.
Play ‘identify the emotion’ game by making faces or holding placards of different smiley. This helps them differentiate emotions and express better; and
not get confused when mingling with other kids or people. “To teach them emotions, it is important that you also communicate to your kids what makes you 
and sad, so when they misbehave I make a straight face and tell them upfront that I am upset,” shares Anita, a proud mother of two boys.


3. Make them communicate:
Verbal or non-verbal, your children should learn to express, interact, and respond to social stimulus. 
Help your children learn appropriate greetings and responses. Kids may need help or guidance to interact with others appropriately, to overcome shyness, 
to manage a response, and express true feelings. Let your children know that they are free to talk, ask, question, and communicate their needs, desires, beliefs and 
ideas. As parents and grandparents, talk to them every day and make generous use of words like ‘please,’ ‘let’s,’ ‘thank you,’ ‘common,’ etc.


4. Give them the environment:
A lonely child may have difficulty in interacting with the world. Give your children good company, exposure, and chances to interact with different types of people.
Kids with social skill deficits often have trouble reading expressions and interacting socially. So activities that get them more comfortable with these 
situations are a great idea. Playschools, hobby classes, playgrounds, sports activities, etc., will give them a chance to socialise. 
When kids mingle with other kids or elders, they develop a range of interpersonal skills that become the foundation of their personality.


5. Prepare them for higher social skills:
A child who can communicate and express himself/herself fearlessly is armed to face the challenges when he/she grows up to tackle complex situations.
Let your children maintain good communication channels, and pick up skills like negotiation, conflict resolution, non-verbal communication, assertiveness, 
bargaining, public-speaking, etc. “My seven-year-old can write emails to his dad, I am glad they have discovered a new means to interact,” says Neha B, a homemaker.





EXERCISE FOR KIDS:

1. Bench step-ups:
 Step right foot, then left, up onto a low bench, then step down. Switch your starting side with each set.
